								<p><b>Abir Ghenaiet: Words and Cultures</b></p>
								<p>I have been very lucky to take my first steps within the world of content creation, translation, and optimization during some of the last few years. My foundation was well laid with a Master’s in Language Translation and Communication from Boston University. The academic background plus the additional certified translator status combined with ATA certification as well as eCommerce certificates obtained through Google put me on a solid base for those professional endeavors.</p>
								<p><b>Content Creation & SEO</b>: From January 2022 to July 2023, I worked with high-profile clients. I created website content, articles, and blogs for diverse customers such as Inkforall.com, Hubforward, Fastclick, and SquaredFinancial. One of my clients wrote this about me: “Abir’s professionalism is truly impressive. Her promptness and attention to detail are exceptional. She always provides amazing quality content that will exceed your expectations."</p>
								<p><b>Research & Data Analysis</b>: In March 2022, I had research projects on diverse topics such as a detailed study on Algeria. Paying attention to precision, I had data analysis projects with firms like NexGenDesign and 361 ventures which asked me to apply my analytical skills.</p>
								<p><b>Editorial & Proofreading</b>: My editorial career took me through HR documents, marketing videos, and even literary novels for clients such as Kevin Digital and Teckler Digital. And here’s a happy client ending with this message from December 2021 “It was our first time to work with Abir and we had a good experience on this hiring. Thanks!”</p>
								<p><b>Diverse Collaborations</b>: My versatility has landed me on top. I have worked with big names like Toyota, Ford Motor, Blankie UAE, Amani Tea among others and have also enjoyed working together with Cactix UAE, D-fly, Alnamaa Group amongst many other pleasant experiences.  From Fortune 500 companies to small business and YouTube channels, my work had been done across continents as well as industries.</p>
								<p>My career, in reflection, has been a tapestry of different projects, patients, clients and continuous learning. Each feedback – if it is not "Good job!" but an elaborate testimonial – is indeed the testament to the sincerity I put into each project and passion I have for my work. As I look ahead to new collaborations, alas carrying experiences from the past with me, yet carrying enthusiasm for future endeavors.</p>
								<p><b>Let's Collaborate!</b>: If my journey resonates with what you're looking for, I'd love to hear from you. Whether it's a new project, a potential collaboration, or just a chat about the industry, I'm always open to connecting.</p>
